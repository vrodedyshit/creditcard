## Context

    Every computer program is a model, hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process.

Credit cards are used to pay for goods and services. Each card has a unique number that helps identify the cardholder and the issuing bank. Credit card numbers are long to ensure each card is unique. For example:

    Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers.
    MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers.
    American Express uses 15-digit numbers.

These numbers are not random. They follow specific patterns:

    Visa numbers start with 4.
    MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55.
    American Express numbers start with 34 or 37.

Credit card numbers also include a "checksum" that helps detect errors. This is done using Luhn's Algorithm, a simple math formula that checks if the number is valid.
